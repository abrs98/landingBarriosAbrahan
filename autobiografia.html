            About me....
        </h1>
    </hr>
            <p>    I am originally from the state of Sinaloa, specifically from the municipality of Angostura, <br>
                place where agriculture, fishing and livestock are the primary activities <br>
                that generate the main source of economic income for families. I was born on 3
                December 1998 in Mazatlán.</p>

                   <br>
             <p>   Son of a farmer and a housewife, I grew up
                in a ranch called El llano, a very hospitable and quiet place surrounded by lands <br>
                agricultural located 10 kilometers from the coast. I attended elementary school there and <br>
                later I studied secondary school in the municipal seat, as well as high school <br>
                (UAS high school). High school was one of the best stages, because of friends and things <br>
                what I learned. Although I was not very good academically, I felt a certain degree of <br>
                satisfaction for contributing something to my family and social environment. I was in the Red Cross, <br>
                as part of my service and I saw from another perspective the risk situations at the <br>
                that we are all exposed, and how we should act. I really like sports, sports
                soccer and volleyball above all. I spent a year in Arizona with the purpose of learning <br>
                English, it was a very productive and profitable year, because for the first time, I had the
                experience of interacting with people from different parts of the world <br>
                and learn a little about their lifestyles and customs. I study engineering career <br>
                software, because I have always liked computers. I took the summer course <br>
                offered by ITSON, and I hope to learn how to make my own mobile applications in this course <br>
                to an acceptable level. I will do my best during this class and throughout the race <br>
                to graduate as a good professional, because I want to contribute to society. for
                I would like to work in the area of ​​creation of management computer systems, <br>
                but I do not rule out my inclination towards other areas as I still have a lot to discover. </p>
